https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api/blob/main/README.md

```java
kaggle.json is needed, see below

store in ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

## GitHub

```java
git init
git add .
git remote remove origin
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:coding-to-music/ev-charging-stations-kaggle.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Get the dataset via the api

```
kaggle datasets download -d saketpradhan/electric-and-alternative-fuel-charging-stations
```

## Exploring Kaggle API Endpoints

After following the steps above, we can begin exploring the use of this package. I would be executing them in a Jupyter Notebook.

The Kaggle API offers the following endpoints with various commands:

```
Competitions {list, files, download, submit, submissions, leaderboard}
Datasets {list, files, download, create, version, init}
Kernels {list, init, push, pull, output, status}
Config {view, set, unset}
Competitions Endpoint
```

Suppose we would like to access the datasets of currently active competitions on Kaggle; we can do so with the following command.

```
!kaggle competitions list
```

Using the other commands, we can also check out the leaderboard scoring for a competition. For example, suppose we are interested to see the leaderboard for the ‚Äúcontradictory-my-dear-watson‚Äù competition.

```
!kaggle competitions leaderboard --show contradictory-my-dear-watson
```

We can also search for competitions with a keyword. For example, suppose we want to search for competitions related to finance.

```
!kaggle competitions list -s finance
```

To check the files associated with a competition dataset, we can use the following command.

```
!kaggle competitions files titanic
```

To explore more endpoints, use the following command.

```
!kaggle competitions -h
```

Datasets Endpoint

Similar to the competitions endpoints, we can also obtain datasets using the datasets endpoint. Thus, we would replace the competition with datasets.

```
!kaggle datasets list
```

We can also sort the datasets by most active and last updated.

```
!kaggle datasets list --sort-by active
```

To explore more endpoints, use the following command.

```
!kaggle datasets -h
```

Downloading, Unzipping and Reading Kaggle Datasets

Finally, we can also download the files associated with a competition or dataset. For example, suppose I am interested in downloading the files for ‚ÄúReddit Vaccine Myth‚Äù.

Firstly, obtain the reference of the dataset. For Reddit Vaccine Myth, we can see that the reference for the dataset is: `gpreda/reddit-vaccine-myths`

```
!kaggle datasets list
```

Once we have the dataset‚Äôs reference, we can download the files using the following command.

```
!kaggle datasets download gpreda/reddit-vaccine-myths
```

By default, the files would be downloaded into your current working Python script directory in a ZIP file.

To extract a ZIP file, use the following function.

```
from zipfile import ZipFile
  
with ZipFile('reddit-vaccine-myths.zip', 'r') as zip:
    zip.printdir()
    zip.extractall()
```

Once that‚Äôs done, read in your files!

```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("reddit_vm.csv")
df.head()
```

Simple as that! Once set up, this would likely help streamline the model building processing by obtaining and reading data directly from Kaggle.
